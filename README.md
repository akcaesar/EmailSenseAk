This is the repository for the Project Email Sense:

I made this to keep track of my huge gmail inbox while I was applying for jobs. I wanted to see some data such as how many applications I made, how many rejections i got, How many invitation mails I got etc.

User can log in to their email, the scripts read the inbox, and then categorizes all the mails into important categories such as spam, job recommendation email, Confirmation of job application email, Rejection email and Interview calls email, and other.
